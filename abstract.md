### Abstract
For most students starting university at Waterloo, although their first term may partially be planned for them, creating an academic schedule for a 5 year degree can be time-consuming, stressful, and difficult. Managing prerequisites and course availability further adds to the mental load of choosing courses every term. Most students either go with the flow and choose courses as they become available, while other students create their own course planning solution using personal documents, checklists, and visualizations. 

We aim to relieve some of the stress of planning a 4 or 5 year degree by contributing to the UWFlow platform and adding a streamlined course planner feature. Every student at the University of Waterloo would benefit from having a central course planning platform tied to the already popular UWFlow website. The platform would aggregate degree requirements, course information (prerequisites and availability for the upcoming academic year) from the University’s undergraduate course schedule to help students visualize their 4/5 year schedules. It will also allow students to select electives they are interested in and the platform will attempt to include these in their future term schedules. Since the UWFlow platform is able to aggregate courses offered every term, users can also choose to be notified if their planned course schedule is no longer viable due to course availability changing. These features would streamline the course planning process and alleviate stress.

Some competitors to this project would be UWPath and uWaterloo’s engadvisor website.  UWPath is also a course planning website, however its user interface relies mostly on the user to “drag and drop” courses onto a term by term schedule either manually or from a list of the major/program’s mandatory courses. This is necessary even if you are an upper year student. By extending off of UWFlow, we could leverage their existing system for parsing transcripts to let students automatically populate the interface with courses they have already taken. uWaterloo’s engadvisor website is more of an administrative tool that provides a checklist of degree requirements that are filled in as a student enrols in and completes courses. Our solution aims to extend this idea further by allowing students to plan their future schedules and fill in checklists with desired electives and core courses, while validating that their planned courses are available and fulfill their degree requirements.

For MP3 our goal is to produce mockups of the user interface that will be created for the course planner. We hope to combine the best aspects of engadvisor, UW Path, and the additional functionality of UW Flow to create our platform. We also aim to add the ability to parse degree requirements from the undergraduate calendar, and recognize when prerequisites have been completed from the transcript parsing capabilities of UW Flow. As a reach goal we would like to implement our user interface and incorporate degree requirement checklists with prerequisites filled from transcripts in our MP3 deliverable.
